# PredictingWaveHeights
Hello! I am currently in my last semester of my undergraduate studies in buisness analytics and data science. I have really enjoyed building models on various datasets throughout 
the past couple months and have learned some interesting things which has resulted in these personal projects on my page. This one is using buoy data from a research pier in Duck, NC
in the outerbanks. I tried predicting wave heights using a variety of measurments from the wind and waves. I've spent my whole life on the coast surfing and pouring over wave predicitions
so this project was especially fun for me. As always I would love to hear your input and construtive critcisms on this or any of my other models. Reach out to me at connorhuis@gmail.com 
for any input or questions. Thank you and enjoy!
